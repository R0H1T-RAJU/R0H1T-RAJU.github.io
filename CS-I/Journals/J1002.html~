    <p>
      1.1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model
      <br>
      Discord and Fortnite
      <br>
      <br>
      2.1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?
      <br>
      Better organization for both users so it's easier for the teacher to know what and where files and
      folders are.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?
      <br>
      So it distinguishes itself from the other files in order for the user to easily find it.
      <br>
      <br>
      4.1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?
      <br>
      Yes, so the user can easily see what directory they are currently in.
      <br>
      <br> 
      5.1: What happens each time you press the &#8593?
      <br>
      It goes to the previous command that the user typed in
      <br>
      <br> 
      5.2: What happens each time you press the &#8595?
      <br>
      It goes to the command entered after the user's current command.
      <br>
      <br> 
      6.1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?
      <br>
      It wasn't printed to the screen because we echoed the text into a file and not the terminal.
      <br>
      <br> 
      7.1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?
      <br>
      The ls command only shows the files and folders in the current directory, but the tree command also
      shows files in all the subdirectories.
      <br>
      <br>
      7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other?
      I would use the ls command to make sure all my files are there and know whats in the current directory.
      I would use the tree command if I wanted to see everything in my subdirectories.
      <br>
      <br>
      8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?
      <br>
      How many seconds the program will sleep for.
      <br>
      <br>
      8.2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?
      <br>
      I was able to prove my hypothesis by running the code and counting until it finished executing.
      <br>
      <br>
      9.1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?
      <br>
      I thought it wouldn't let me use the terminal while it ran.
      <br>
      <br>
      9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?
      <br>
      It will run and still allow the user to use the terminal as normal.
      <br>
      <br>
      9.3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?
      <br>
      The index of the job.
      <br>
      <br>
      10.1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?
      <br>
      It shows the list of jobs that were created and if they are running or finished.
      <br>
      <br>
      10.2: How do you explain your observations?
      <br>
      The terminal shows the names of the jobs that I created
    </p>

      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
      <br>
      I learned how to efficiently use the tabby terminal and useful commands to make my work easier.
      <br>
      <br>
      What challenges did I encounter?
      <br>
      I didn't really encounter any problems during this lesson.
      <br>
      <br>
      How could this experience be improved?
      <br>
      N/A
      <br>
      <br>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
      <br>
      It affected my thinking by showing me there are shortcuts to many long and tedious tasks. In the future I will
      continue finding quicker ways to do simple tasks.
