      1.1: Compare this behavior to that of the while loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences?
      <br>
      Both the "while" and "repeat-while" loops evaluate a condition and keep repeating through their bodies until that condition is met. However, the "while" loop evaluates the condition before it runs while the "repeat-while" loop evaluates the condition after it runs. This means that the "repeat-while" loop will run at least once even if the condition is met, but the "while" loop wont. 
      <br>
      <br>
      1.2: What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute?
      <br>
      It will execute a minimum of 1 time.
      <br>
      <br>
      1.3: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?
      <br>
      So that the condition will be re-evaluated and the code can decide whether or not to run the "consequent" or "alternative" function depending on the boolean value.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.1: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a while loop using a repeat-while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.
      <br>
      No, because the "while" loop checks the conditional before it runs which can't be replicated with a "repeat-while" loop since it executes before checking its conditional.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.2: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.
      <br>
      Yes, you could add another statement before the while loop that is identical to its body so that instructions are run at least once no matter what the conditional statement is.

      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
      <br>
      I learned what a "repeat-while" loop was and the differences between it and a regular "while" loop. I also learned its use cases when programming.
      <br>
      <br>
      What challenges did I encounter?
      <br>
      I didn't encounter any problems during this lesson.
      <br>
      <br>
      How could this experience be improved?
      <br>
      N/A
      <br>
      <br>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
      <br>
      This lesson affected my thinking by introducing a new useful function call "repeat-while" and how i can properly utilize it while I code. It also helped me understand its intricacies by showing me how it looks in Assembly Language.
