      1.1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?
      <br>
      It enables the use of multiple different pathways or "branches" which allows the code to perform various task based on a single boolean statement.
      <br>
      <br>
      1.2: Why do you think the term <i>consequent</i> is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the <i>boolean test</i> evaluates to true? 
      <br>
      It's referred to as consequent because the statement is executed as a consequence of the boolean statement being true.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.2: Why is the first <i>jump</i> instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?
      <br>
      The first jump instruction is conditional because we only want it to run if a certain condition is met. In this instance, the condition that determines whether the jump will be executed is if the value stored in the memory is less than or equal to 4.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.2: What is the purpose of the <i>jump</i> instruction after the <i>consequent</i>?
      <br>
      So that the program will skip over the "alternative" function and jump directly to the "afterAlternate" function.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.3: Why is there no need for a corresponding <i>jump</i> instruction after the <i>alternative</i>?
      <br>
      There is no need for a corresponding <i>jump</i> instruction because there nothing it needs to skip over. Since there are no other functions between the "alternative" and "afterAlternative" functions, it can execute them in sequence without needing to jump.

      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
      <br>
      I learned how to create flow charts and the diffrent methods that are used to execute code such as sequentional and branched flows.
      <br>
      <br>
      What challenges did I encounter?
      <br>
      I didn't really encounter any problems during this lesson.
      <br>
      <br>
      How could this experience be improved?
      <br>
      N/A
      <br>
      <br>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
      <br>
      What I've learned has affected by my thinking my showing me news ways of executing code. I can use my knowledge of branched and sequential programming on ufuture Computer Science projects.
