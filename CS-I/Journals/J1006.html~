      1.1: What is Git communicating to you?
      <br>
      It is communicating what I commited to the git, the specific commit tag, and some details on when I did it
      <br>
      <br>
      1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?
      <br>
      The git log shows me what i commited to the git when I entered "git commit"  as well as the time and date it happened.
      <br>
      <br>
      1.3: Why do you think this is?
      <br>
      This is because it is logging to the system everytime I commit, so it shows up when I git log in order to keep track of what changes I made.
      <br>
      2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?
      <br>
      File1 is displayed in the git status as a file that has a new change that needs to be added. However, file2 is under untracked files since we just created it inside of the directory.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?
      <br>
      They aren't in the same section because one of the files has new changes added to it and the other file was just created.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?
      <br>
      Both file1 and file2 are displayed as added but they still need to be commited.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.
      <br>
      file1 is a modified file that needs to be commited and file2 has been created and needs to be commited.
      <br>
      <br>
      4.1: How many files are listed as having been changed?
      <br>
      2 files are listed as having been changed.
      <br>
      <br>
      4.2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?
      <br>
      The differences that are listed for each file is what was added to it and they are displayed in the color green.
      <br>
      <br>
      5.1: Execute the commands
      <br>
      Git didn't return anything because no changes to the files were made after they were commited.
