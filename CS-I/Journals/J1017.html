      <h2>Half Adder & Full Adder</h2>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/29x782by"><img src="Pictures/adders.png" alt="half-adder & full-adder"/></a>
      <br>
      <br>
      1.1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?
      <br>
      The AND truth table.
      <br>
      <br>
      1.2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?
      <br>
      The XOR truth table.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?
      <br>
      They have the same outputs.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.2: Why is this true?
      <br>
      The carry input is 0 so it doesnt affect the outputs.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?
      <br>
      There will be no carries in the least significant bit position so a full-adder isn't needed.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?
      <br>
      No, because the carries on the adders depend on the digit to the left of it so it needs to wait for those processes to complete.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C<sub>15</sub> is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?
      <br>
      We can infer that A and B were large numbers. This state is commonmly called a Ripple Carry Adder.

    <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
      <br>
      How computers perfrom addition through the use of half-adders and full-adders.
      <br>
      <br>
      What challenges did I encounter?
      <br>
      I didn't encounter any problems during this lesson.
      <br>
      <br>
      How could this experience be improved?
      <br>
      N/A
      <br>
      <br>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
      <br>
      This lesson showed me how computers preform basic function such as addition through the use of logic gates. It taught me what half-adders and full-adders are which are essential to a computer's functionality.
