      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 22px">A technical challenge that I came across was the introduction of the new language Swift. Although it seems to be minor challenge since I know Python and Java and Swift seems like a mix of both. However, I will overcome this challenge by  spending the next few days researching and becoming fluent in the language in order to ensure my teams success in our independent study project</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Scheduling challenges</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 22px">We didn't really encounter any schedule changes. However, that was mostly due to the fact that half our team was not here so we weren't able to discuss our schedules. However the main schedule issue I see arising is not having enough class time. However, a solution is using discord to communicate outside of school</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Interpersonal challenges</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 22px">I didn't encounter any interpersonal challenges mostly due to the fact 2 people from my team weren't here and we were just assignmed this project. However, a way I will solve future issues is by talking it out and making sure everyones ideas are being heard and everyone is able to properly contribute to the group.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>(Software) Development Engineer</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 22px">A software development engineer is responsible for designing and building software applications. This may involve writing code, working with a team to design and implement new features, and debugging and troubleshooting issues. They may also be responsible for maintaining and improving existing software applications. Software development engineers typically work with a variety of programming languages and technologies. I am well versed in a variety of programming languages and am confident in my abilities. However, I will definitely run into many bugs throughout the process, but I can use Stack Overflow to assist with my issues.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>QA Engineer</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 22px">A quality assurance (QA) engineer is responsible for testing software to ensure that it meets the necessary requirements and is free of defects. This may involve writing and executing test plans  and using testing tools and techniques to identify and report on any issues that are discovered. I don't feel that I am well suited for this position because as I would rather directly code the software than test for issues and fine tune it to perfection.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Project Manager</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 22px">A project manager is responsible for overseeing the work of a team to ensure that a project is completed on time and within budget. This may involve developing project plans, assigning tasks to team members, and managing resources such as time and money. I believe I am well suited for this position as I have previous experience in directing a team and making sure they finish their tasks on time and everything operates smoothly. Some challenges I will encounter are having to remind team members to meet deadlines and keep everyone on task.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Product Manager</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 22px">A product manager is responsible for the development and management of a product throughout its lifecycle. This may involve refining the product's features and working with other members to bring the product to market. Product managers may also be responsible for monitoring the product's performance after its release and making adjustments as needed. This is a position I would like since I enjoy updating the projects I work on by adding new features and making it the best possible version it can be. However, it could be a tough position to work on as I will constantly have to monitor the program and make sure it runs smoothly, but I can overcome this by working on it at home as well as in class</p>
