      <h2 style="font-size: 18px">The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">Recommendation algorithms are a crucial component of many online platforms, aiming to assist users in discovering relevant content or products. Everytime a user does something such as searching for a specific item, liking a specific post, or watching a certain video, that data is stored and processed by recommendation algorithms. These algorithms use that data and item characteristics to make suggestions that are personalized based on that data. Machine learning and data mining techniques are often used to train these recommendation algorithms, continually improving their ability to provide users with tailored and engaging content or product recommendations.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 18px">The Feedback Loop</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">Feedback loops play a fundamental role in recommendation algorithms, constantly learning and enhancing the suggestions provided to users. When a user interacts with recommendations, such as by clicking or purchasing a suggested item, this interaction generates feedback. The algorithm uses this feedback to learn more about the user's preferences and interests, adjusting future recommendations accordingly. This process creates a positive feedback loop where user actions lead to more personalized recommendations, which, in turn, encourage more user engagement. As users continue to interact with recommendations and provide feedback, the algorithm becomes increasingly accurate in tailoring its suggestions, resulting in a continuous cycle of improvement and personalization.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">Conspiracy theories and algorithmic amplification are an extremely harmful pair. Social media platforms and recommendation algorithms can inadvertently fuel the spread of conspiracy theories by prioritizing enticing or divisive content. Users tend to be more drawn to this type of content because outlandish or bizzare headlines tend to pique curiosity and encourage interaction. When users engage with this content, the algorithms will in turn show more of it, creating a positive feedback loop. This can lead to the rapid spread of misinformation, often with real-world consequences.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Platform Incentives</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">The fundamental goal for many digital platforms is to boost user engagement which directly correlates with increased ad impressions and in turn, increased revenue. However, this pursuit of engagement sometimes tilts the balance away from ensuring the quality and accuracy of the content that is shown. In the absence of robust checks and balances, the recommendation algorithms can unintentionally amplify false information at the expense of more nuanced, truthful content.. As mentioned above, misinformation generates more interaction whether in the form of ignorant users believing it to be true or those commenting about the incorrect information, leading to recommendation algorithms pushing these over less enticing content.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Potential for Exploitation</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">Those who have a deep understanding of how recommendation algorithms function can exploit them for malicious intent. For example, YouTube, one of the largest platforms that is centered around recommendation algorithms, has been increasingly saturated with clickbait. Predatory tactics such as thumbnails with exaggerated expressions and bright colors along with outlandish titles lead to increased interaction with that content. This manipulates the algorithm into suggesting this type of content to more and more people, inadvertently spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories with it. Although platforms do make efforts to stop the spread of conspiracy theories, the sheer volume of such content makes it nearly impossible to completely eliminate.</p>
